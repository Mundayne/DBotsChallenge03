# Challenge 3: Backin' Up

## Introduction:
Using my incredible powers of deduction and logical reasoning akin to Sherlock Holmes himself, I have ascertained that people want another coding challenge. There is irony in this, however, as we only recieved one submission for the last challenge. I haven't announced a winner yet purely because I haven't actually tested to see if the submission meets the criteria. Anyway, there was some discussion in #discussion about a malicious bot going around and deleting servers and how it would be useful if Discord had a server backup feature. And that's where you come in. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to create a bot capable of backing up a server.

## Objectives:
1. The primary objective of this challenge is to create a Server Backup Bot containing the features set out below.
2. The bot should be capable of backing up: server, channel category, channel and role settings; and channels and channel categories.
3. Optionally it may back up members and the roles they have, as well as webhooks.
4. A server administrator should be able to choose what they want backed up - how detailed this selection is, is at your discretion.
5. The backup should happen automatically at a time / day / time interval / etc. specified by a server administrator.
6. Backups can be stored however you want, however the backups cannot be stored on the same server as the bot - it must be given to the server administrator so they can "load" a backup at will.
7. The bot must be ToS compliant - notably, End User Data must be stored encrypted.

## Submission:
1. Create a fork of this repo.
2. Create a folder within the repo named with your name.
3. Work inside that folder.
4. Create a pull request to the original repo when done.
